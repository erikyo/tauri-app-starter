# App

The Tauri Todo App is a full-stack application designed as a starting point for building feature-rich, containerized applications. 

### RestAPI Server
The API server is built using Fastify, a high-performance web framework for Node.js. The server is configured with HTTPS, logging, authentication via Supertokens, and Swagger documentation.

### Frontend App
A simple Todo application built with React, React Router, and Tauri APIs. The frontend integrates Supertokens for secure authentication.

### Features

**Dockerized Environment**: Utilizes Docker Compose to orchestrate services such as MySQL, Supertokens, and Fastify API for seamless development.

**Frontend (React) App**: A simple Todo application built with React, React Router, Tailwind, and Tauri APIs. The frontend integrates Supertokens for secure authentication.

**Fastify REST API**: Employs Fastify, a high-performance web framework, for the backend API. The API supports CRUD operations for managing tasks.

**Supertokens Authentication**: Enhances security with Supertokens, providing a robust authentication mechanism for user sessions.

**Tauri Integration**: Utilizes Tauri, a framework for building native-like applications, to package and distribute the app across different platforms.


### Docker-compose will bring up a full-stack application with the following services:

- db-supertokens: MySQL database for Supertokens. (port 3307)
- supertokens: Supertokens service. (port 3456)
- db-app: MySQL database for the application. (port 3306)
- adminer: Adminer for MySQL database management (port 3002)
- api: Dockerized Fastify API server (port 3001)

npm run build-app
```

## Publishing the app

In order to release the app you need to copy the env file and name it `.env.production`. Then edit that file using the production ip, ports, secrets and run 

`
npm run build-app
`

That's it!ðŸŽ‰ Tauri will build the Windows/Linux/MacOs app following the configuration located in [tauri.conf.json](https://github.com/erikyo/tauri-app-starter/blob/master/app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)
